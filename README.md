# Retail-Customer-Retention-Intelligence
📊 Retail Customer Retention & Churn Intelligence System
🎯 Business Context (Landmark Group Focus)
In high-velocity retail and quick-commerce environments, customer loyalty is the primary driver of sustainable growth. Research shows that maintaining an existing customer is 5x more cost-effective than acquisition.

This project delivers a Predictive Analytics Engine designed to identify "at-risk" customers and transform raw data into actionable insights that drive process enhancements and digital workflows.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Corporate Theming: Implemented IBM-style visualization standards using Seaborn whitegrid themes for executive-ready reporting.

Feature Engineering: Developed custom metrics to analyze behavioral patterns, specifically identifying high-risk segments in "Month-to-Month" contracts.

Data Integrity: Applied rigorous cleaning processes to handle operational noise, ensuring 100% data integrity for digital menu and subscription services.

📈 Key Insights & Results
Identification of High-Risk Segments: Discovered that Month-to-Month contract types exhibit the highest churn volatility.

Strategic Recommendation: Recommended automated retention campaigns and loyalty triggers for specific behavioral clusters to reduce churn by an estimated 15-20%.
